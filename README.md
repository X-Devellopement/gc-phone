# Phone
Modified [esx_phone](https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_phone) script for my needs.

## FEATURES

Added options:
        - Ability to set whether the phone is purchaseable (needed to be purchased) to work.
        - Automatic reply system for EMS / LSPD when a player takes a summon from a player.
        - Automatic notification for EMS / LSPD when a summon is taken so other players in EMS / LSPD dont all go together.

## INSTALLATION

For the full script to work you must add "blackberry" to items in your db and also add it to the shops table, for a player to purchase the phone in order to use it.

All Notifications and the whole script is translated to POLISH, I will not provide any other translation but feel free to commit.
I can - on request - add an english one :)
